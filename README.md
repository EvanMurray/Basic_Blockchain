# Basic_Blockchain
I have created a blockchain alongside a series of videos and will use github to log my improvements upon the program.

This project utilizes Flask to add a front-end ui for interacting with the blockchain. To run the program, execute python node.py
in the terminal with an optional -p/--port flag to designate the port on which it will run. (5000 by default). It currently can interact with
other local nodes on your local machine setup on seperate terminals. i.e. localhost:5000, localhost:5001.
